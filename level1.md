Requesting challenge...

> I Love Lance & Janice  

> You've caught two of your fellow minions passing coded notes back and forth -- while they're on duty, no less! Worse, 
> you're pretty sure it's not job-related -- they're both huge fans of the space soap opera "Lance & Janice". You know 
> how much Commander Lambda hates waste, so if you can prove that these minions ares wasting time passing 
> non-job-related notes, it'll put you that much closer to a promotion.  
>   
> Fortunately for you, the minions aren't exactly advanced cryptographers. In their code, every lowercase letter [a..z] 
> is replaced with the corresponding on in [z..a], while every other character (including uppercase letters and 
> punctuation) is left untouched. That is, 'a' becomes 'z', 'b' becomes 'y', 'c' becomes 'x', etc. For instance, the 
> word "vmxibkgrlm", when decoded, would become "encryption".  
>   
> Write a function called solution(s) which takes in a string and returns the deciphered string so you can show the 
> commander proof that these minios are talking about "Lance & Janice" instead of doing their jobs.
